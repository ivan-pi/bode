The author Jeffrey R. Thorson was a member of the
Stanford Exploration Project and student (?) of Jon Claerbout, geophysics
professor at Stanford University. Thorson's Dissertation (1984) is catalogued
at: https://search.worldcat.org/en/title/38632165

The routines use column storage of the matrix, i.e. the diagonals are stored
as columns, similar to SLATEC.
