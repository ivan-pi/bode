A low-order adaptive solver for implicit ODE's

The solver has been extracted from:

The method used appeared originally in

Mathematics of Computation, 28(125), 145-162. https://doi.org/10.1090/S0025-5718-1974-0331793-2, [PDF](https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/1974-28-125/S0025-5718-1974-0331793-2/S0025-5718-1974-0331793-2.pdf)
